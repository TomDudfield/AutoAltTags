# AutoAltTags

If you want to compile your own dll or pull the code you can do so from here.

Otherwise head over to the [Sitecore Marketplace](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/en/Modules/A/Alt_Tag_Generator.aspx) to download a Sitecore package. The module should work with versions 8.0 and above.

You will need to [generate a API key](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/subscriptions) for the Computer Vision API and add the key into 'AutoAltTags.Config' for the module to work. An alt tag will be generated upon uploading or saving a media item. If an alt tag is already set it won't be overridden.
